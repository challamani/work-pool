# Work Pool

Idea behind this project is to reduce the unemployment in a particular region/zone/state by posting the work orders publicly.

With this service anybody can post a work order publicly and the members who are unemployed in that region/zone are eligible for estimating that work and their profile/skill-set should match to enable them estimate/bidding the work.
